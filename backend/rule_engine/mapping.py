"""
PackWise Risk Prediction Engine — Dataset Mapping
====================================================
Bridges the team's actual product dataset (packaging_dataset.csv /
Salinan_Engineering_Database.xlsx) into the ProductFeatures input contract.

v2 — updated after the team confirmed physical packaging-construction
fields (box thickness, cushion, clearance) are OUT OF SCOPE. Also corrected
support_points: the flat CSV has no "current_*_strap" (CV-detected) columns,
only "recommended_*_strap" columns. Per the original DFD design, the Risk
Prediction Engine (5.0) evaluates the Packaging Recommendation Engine's
(3.0) OUTPUT — so using recommended_*_strap as support_points is the
correct interpretation, not a workaround: we are evaluating drop/movement
risk FOR the proposed attachment plan.
